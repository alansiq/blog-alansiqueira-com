# My first week at a Software Developer job

This is it! I finally did it! I’m now employed as a software developer at a company I truly like. It took me quite some time to get here I felt the need to share my story. I was an UI/UX Designer one year and a half ago. It might not sound like a long time, but back then there was no covid or remote work - I was planning to study software development “the old way, as in, not remotely like we do today and life was different.

With the epidemic, I had to change plans. My career turned upside down and I had to deal with this disease happening to people really close to me. It’s hard to see opportunity and find the motivation when you are dealing with an epidemic so close to you. Eventually I had to find the motivation to carry on, and I am glad it happened.

You see, I never really considered myself starting from scratch. Even though I was a Designer and inclined to think visually rather than logically, I had tried to learn programming a couple of times before. I even started college to become a Database Administrator at one point in my life, but dropped that idea one year later. Don’t get the wrong idea of me, I’m not lazy and I don’t give up easily, it’s just that I have a hard time sticking to a 5 years scheudule of study. I want to accomplish, I want to skip to the fun part. When I wanted to learn programming, I wanted to embrace it and learn _true_ programming immediatly! I just couldn’t sit down for a whole quarter of soft skills and math before I wrote any line of code.

I always thought there was something wrong with me, my parents thought I didn’t like to study or had the patience to do so. It took me long enough to realize that I was studying the wrong way.

# I learn by doing.

Of course it’s not always possible, but I get drained and burned out so quickly if I can’t see where a class is going or why the hell I’m even there. I get it, the fundamentals are there for a reason and I felt the need to go back to the basics more than I’d like to admit during my journey, but it still felt faster than sitting at a college room.

During my day to day, finding a challenge and trying to solve it kept my motivation high. It never felt like studying, because I had a clear goal in mind and every docummentation I read or every tutorial I watched - I felt like I was closer to accomplishing it. Even if by just a little bit.

# The transition.

When the pandemic hit, I had to occupy myself. At this point, I was starting at UI/UX Design and felt the need to over deliver at work. Thankfuly, the company I worked for at that moment really rewarded me for a well done work - and it kept my motivation going.

It was not just about working well, I really wanted to be a professional designer. And I know exactly what I needed to get there: a good-looking portfolio. And it couldn’t be _just_ a Wordpress Website or a simple WYSIWYG page creator. I had to build it myself, from scratch!

And from there my journey started. I knew the basics of HTML & CSS. It was all I needed, right? How hard could it be? I designed a couple of wireframes on Figma, made myself a hot cup of coffee and begun to work on it.

I faced so many problems and had to go back so many times, you wouldn’t believe it. One year and a thousand iterations later, it was done. But each of these iterations led me to learn at least something new. During this proccess, I practiced a lot of my CSS and learned about SASS. I took the time to truly learn Bootstrap and its semantics. I dived into React and it opened my eyes to a thousand other apps I would love to build.

I invested into acquiring my own domain, a VPS and deployed complex applications with data persistance and back-end frameworks. At one point, I noticed I was so passionate about programming - I had stopped studying about Design.

# Don’t burn out!

I don’t remember exactly when, but I had to point out the obvious. I wanted to quit designing interfaces to develop them. You see, I don’t consider myself a front-end developer by any means, but I can’t hide I’m passionate for a well made UI and a good user experience. But if I wanted to trail a software development career, I really had to see the big picture and learn everything there is to learn.

At this point in life, me and my wife worked from home. I had no reason to leave our house (it was a pandemic, afterall) and my day gained extra study hours since I didn’t have to drive to (and from) work anymore. I took that extra time to study. I subscribed to tech news, I paid for online courses, I enrolled into bootcamps. I was giving 100% of myself.

I remember dreaming about solutions and projects I could build and I never felt confident to try and apply for a software development job.
