## Object Oriented Programming principles

This week I have focused my efforts diving into the world of Object Oriented Programming. A clear choice for me was to pick up another programming language and learn everything fresh.

After doing some research I followed my heart and picked up Java again. You see, back in college a teacher would make us code in notepad and compile the code with a CLI, so I had some good memories about Java from way back then.

## But what is Object Oriented Programming?

Object Oriented Programming is a methodology of software development. It has some concepts that should help you build scalable applications and reusable code. It all goes back to 4 major pillars, as they call it.

## Abstraction

A method or object should only display what is absolutely necessary. One of the pillars of OOP is that you should abstract your code to where it makes the most sense.

## Inheritance

In my opinion, one of the greatest strengths of OOP is the reusability of code. Inheritance plays a major role here, as it allows you to extend different classes and add new usability to it without rewriting the parent.

In Java, it's the miracle of "extends". One class can be child of another, but with altered methods and properties or even new ones.

## Polymorphism

It's the method in an object-oriented programming language that performs different things as per the object's class, which calls it. With Polymorphism, a message is sent to multiple class objects, and every object responds appropriately according to the properties of the class.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
